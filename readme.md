# Hex to rgb conversion helpers

This is a short challenge to create first a function that can take a hexidecimal colour code like `#01050f` and return a ruby map with the RGB values such as `{r: 1, g: 5, b: 15}`.

.. and then to use that to build a class that can convert both ways around :)


## Tests

The tests for this are written in rspec. Your goal is to have all tests passing when running `rspec` from the root of the project.

Checkout the test file to see what is expected. Note that we only test the 'happy path', and only 6 digit codes (even though 3 digit codes are valid in CSS).
